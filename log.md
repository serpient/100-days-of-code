**Today's Progress**: Finished watching SD4x video on D3, Node.js, and Express, and a few intro videos on MongoDB

**Thoughts**: This is pretty confusing, hopefully the homework will help cement these concepts.

**Today's Progress**: Finished SD4x react-app homework. Continue watching videos about Es6

**Thoughts**: React-app homework took longer than I thought. My javascript is getting rusty, and the parent data passed down to children (and backup) definetly needs more practice. Also, I'm surprised by the amount of nesting the React components are doing in the example homework.

**Today's Progress**: Started SD4x Homework (react app), implemented a few components but got stuck on enzyme unit testing for 2 hours. Finished the Chingu Network mockup.

**Thoughts:** Enzyme unit testing is very frustrating - Trying to get it to simulate adding values to an input box and clicking submit, but haven't gotten it to work. Real bummer since I really want to try unit testing development.
