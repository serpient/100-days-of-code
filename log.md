**Today's Progress**: Started SD4x Homework (react app), implemented a few components but got stuck on enzyme unit testing for 2 hours. Finished the Chingu Network mockup.

**Thoughts:** Enzyme unit testing is very frustrating - Trying to get it to simulate adding values to an input box and clicking submit, but haven't gotten it to work. Real bummer since I really want to try unit testing development.
