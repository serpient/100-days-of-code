# 100 Days Of Code Log - Start Date: December 28, 2017

### Day 6: January 6, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Finished wikipedia FCC mini-project and twitch.tv project as well. 

**Thoughts**: Good practice wtih API calls and CSS grid. Having trouble centering a row of CSS grid to align with another set of CSS grid elements below it. Had initial issues with packaging offline stream channels, but it wasnt because of the conditional (if/else), but because I called for properties not available in the null object. This would have been obvious if I looked at the developers tool console log more carefully. 
### Day 5: January 5, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Watching CS50 lecture 8 on python examples. Started back up on FCC wikipedia codepen project

**Thoughts**: Wow, I definetly need to practice more smaller projects that work with APIs. Yet again, I am struggling with grabbing data from the API. 
### Day 4: January 4, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Watching CS50 lecture 7 and 8.

**Thoughts**: Loss day yesterday and half of today due to moms surgery. Lecture is on python, going through its syntax. Interesting that C syntax is closer to javascript than python. Also, its so much easier to use python to implement stuff than C. 
### Day 3: January 2, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Watched more SD4x videos on mongoDB. Switched to CS50 lecture 6. 

**Thoughts**: As an aside, I had previously finished all of the CS50 homework up to Dictionary, the last of which I only had pseudo code. I got frustrated and gave up, so glad to watch the next lecture video, only for it to jump right into an introduction of client/server and html!
### Day 2: January 1, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Finished watching SD4x video on D3, Node.js, and Express, and a few intro videos on MongoDB

**Thoughts**: This is pretty confusing, hopefully the homework will help cement these concepts.
### Day 1: December 31, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Finished SD4x react-app homework. Continue watching videos about Es6

**Thoughts**: React-app homework took longer than I thought. My javascript is getting rusty, and the parent data passed down to children (and backup) definetly needs more practice. Also, I'm surprised by the amount of nesting the React components are doing in the example homework. 

### Day 0: December 28, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: Started SD4x Homework (react app), implemented a few components but got stuck on enzyme unit testing for 2 hours. Finished the Chingu Network mockup.

**Thoughts:** Enzyme unit testing is very frustrating - Trying to get it to simulate adding values to an input box and clicking submit, but haven't gotten it to work. Real bummer since I really want to try unit testing development.
